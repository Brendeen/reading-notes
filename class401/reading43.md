## Open source

What exactly is an open source software contribution, or OSS?

Open source software is software anyone can use of write. This allows any user to access the code, modify, distribute and push up their changes. Making it open source means any user can add a feature as long as it gets approved by the owner of the OSS.

Overall if you are a new developer and want to work with some new people and maybe even advance frameworks and technology as a whole, not only is it a great way to get your name out there, build up connections and also maybe gain some experience, but potentially thousands of other people will see your code and can even make it better/more efficient.
