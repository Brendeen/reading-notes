### Assessments

![Bias assessment](../401-pictures/bias-assessment.png)

Emotional intelligents results -

- self-awarness, 19
- self-managment, 16
- social awarness, 21
- relationship managment, 17

This was good informtaion to assess and see a visable score on paper. I know now that self managment is something i should work on more. For example I tend to put off certain things until I really need to do them. Social awarness has always been a skill of mine though, as I tend to read people pretty well.
