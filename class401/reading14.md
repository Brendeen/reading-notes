## Data visualization

Q. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

- Matplotlib is library that is used forplotting 2d graphics. Its primarily used for making simple graphics like charts and graphs. Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and is used for more complex graphics such as correlation matrices and categorial plots. Finally Bokeh is an interactive library used to make interactive visuals and graphics, using features like zooming in and out and panning.

Q. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

1. Relational plots, used to compare the relationship of an x and y variable
- scatterplot()
- lineplot()

2. Categorical Plots:, used for categorising data
- barplot()
- boxplot()

3. Distribution plots, used for accessing the distribution of data
- histplot()
- kdeplot()

Q. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

- The cheat sheet is very useful if a developer either doesnt remember how to use the Seaborn library or is using it for the first time, having reference of all the functions on hand can make your workflow go much quicker. A great example is the categorial plots section showing you what each function will show visually/ how it will display your data.
