## Fetting started with Django

Q. What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

- Django uses an architecture called MVT, or model, view and template. Models are the puthon classes that define the behaviors of your data, views are responcible for handling http requests, and the template defines the html layout of your page. You of course can also impliment CSS, Javascript, a Django template, and python code.

Q. Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.

- The model represents the data of the app, this layer handles data retreval.
- The template is responcible for the presentation of the app, this layer handles the response.
- the view receives the web request and handles the logic, this layer returns an http response.

Q. What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?

- Tailwind CSS is a framework that like bootstrap makes css work much easier, however unlike bootstrap and other frameworks, tailwind offers a different approach to styling. Instead of providing already styled elements, tailwind allows the user to create their own reusable components. These can be re used on other element of your site!
