## Discussion questions...

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

	I bring my unrivaled creativity to the table, along with my willingness to learn and understand. Even if there is a certain feature of a website I don’t quite understand or don’t know how to execute, I am open to learning from these mistakes and further my knowledge of the language.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

	First off I will access what exactly it is I don’t understand, so I can make an in-depth google search, as well as looking back at the many resources I have such as previous and current recordings, code examples in GitHub, and previous labs and code challenges. If I don’t find a working answer within 15 minutes, I will call the teacher or a TA over to my table, as well as asking any of my fellow classmates if they have any helpful advice or workarounds when I am working with another person or multiple people.
