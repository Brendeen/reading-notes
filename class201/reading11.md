## Video and audio content

Q. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

Q. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element.

- src is where the source of your video is coming from, pretty much a path to the users computer, while controls is how to manipulate the video like volume, pausing, and skipping content by fast forwarding.

Q. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element?

- this is important incase the browser does not support the video element or content. You can provide an alternate message and even link to the video source.

Q. Write a very short story where audio and video are characters.

- Video and audio are good friends, but could only communicate through sound and images. Though they are different in many ways, they always band together to make a full experience.
