## Learn HTML

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

- When the content doesnt need to be listed or can be random. When the content doesnt matter how its presented.

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

- By using the css style list-style-type.

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

- When content on your page needs to be shown in an order, like "start with step 1, then proceed to step 2."

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

- Using the attribute "type" in the ol tag, you can change the list to be roman numerals by typing ol type="i", and using start in the ol tag will let you start from any number and continue down. You type ol start="number". you can start from any number

## Learn CSS

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

- The margin is the invisible space around the content, its job is to grow or shrink to provide space for the content to breath. While the padding is on the outside between the border and margin, making sure the border has room to protect the margin and content.

2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- The 4 parts of the box model are the padding, which is the space outside the border and is used to push away other content from its own box. The border is in between the margin and padding and can be styled a number of different ways and can get bigger or smaller depending on the users desired height and width. The margin is the invisible space in between the content and border and is the can shrink to the contents size of get bigger. lastly the content on the inside is whatever the user put in their html document.

## Learn JS

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?

- Strings, objects, numbers, and other arrays. You can even mix different data in an array like numbers and strings.

2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

- 

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

- Assignment operator, will assign a value to its left operand based on the right.
- Comparison operator, will compare the 2 operands and give back a value based on if the comparison is true.
- Arithmatic operator, this will take 2 numerical value operands and produce a single numerical value from the 2.
- Comma operand, this operator evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand, or the one ending the expression.
- Relational operator, this operator will compare its operands and return a boolean value, or true or false depending if the value is true.

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

- I think the result would equal 10dog. Because the false would be cancelled out and then it would just be 10, + dog would make it 10dog.

5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

- A password could be an example. if the user writes the right password, then they will be let into their account. if not, they get blocked from entering their account.

6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

- A loop can be useful when you want someone to get a specific answer in a prompt, so you can loop it until they get the right answer.
