Q. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

Q. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

- First i would have to make sure its a web safe font, meaning it will appear on the browser my webpage is running on. Foreground, size and weight are things i would consider as well to make sure the font is still readable and not to big or small.

Q. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

- Font size measures how big the text will be, font weight will measure how bold the font is, and font style will turn italics on or off.

Q. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

- line height is the easiest way, but you can also use padding to make space for the h1. Maybe text align as well but im not sure.

## Things I want to learn more about.

Looking more into styling with fonts interests me, i didnt realize you could do way more with the actual text then i thought. As well as looking more into the box-model in css.
