## CSS flexbox

Q. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

- One-dimensional means that it deals with layout in single directions, meaning columns or rows

Q. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

- Main access is the row your content is in and is set to the flex-direction property. While the Cross axis is the oposite, running along the column.

Q. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

- Reordering html elements can sometimes make visually impaird users screen readers break, for example the row-reverse and column-reverse can reverse how a nav bar will be orientated, making the screen reader read out in the wrong order.
