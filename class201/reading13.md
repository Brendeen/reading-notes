## Local storage

Q. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

- It is mainly used to cache user data for later, and provides much more storage than a cookie.

Q. What information should not be stored in local storage?

- any sensitive data should not be saved, as someone could access the data stored.

Q. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

- local storage can only store strings, so whatever you need to store must be converted into string format.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to see examples of what other websites store in their local data.
