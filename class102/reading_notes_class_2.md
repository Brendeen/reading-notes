# Class 2

[Back to home page](../README.md)

In this class, we looked into **Text Editors** and why they are important.

- Text editors are super important for developers because thats where they write all their code, so its important to know which program is right for you!
- Each text editor is different and includes features you can download or are pre-loaded onto the program already.

Some great example features are:

1. Code completion, a feature that will allow the software to guess and help you write your code as you go. It can close tags automaticlly, write entire lines with the push of a button, and make suggestions to the user.
2. Syntax highlighting, this feature colors all your attributes and elements to help finding errors a little easier.
3. Themes, a good selection of themes is good to have to make coding easy on the eyes. For example most coders use a dark background with bright colors.

Pluggins are also a great way to get more done with less work, and can be game changing later on as you get more firmiliar with your programs features. They can act as powerful features that your text editor may have not had before!

Every computer also comes with its own text editor pre installed, but is not recommended sense there are very few features set up within these programs.

Some examples of text editors are-

- VScode
- Sublime text
- Brackets
- Atom
- Notepad++

## Command line/Terminal

We also learned about the terminal, a feature on computers where you can type out commands and the terminal will respond with a textual answer. The command line will start off with a prompt depending on what directory you are in, then you type your command and a prompt will show up once you hit enter.

- All terminals contain what is known as a shell, this will determine how the terminal will look and execute commands once they are typed in.

Useful commands that i have found so far include-

1. pwd, or *present working directory* will tell you were your current working directory is.
2. ls, this command will list content in the directory. In other words it will show you your files.
3. cd, cd will change your directory, to do so you must put the file name after cd
4. cd .., this command will take you back a step or to a previous file. the more periods (.) you add, the further back it will go. .... will make you go back 3 pages.

Those are only some basic commands, there are tons to try out!

*Paths* are another important part about command lines

- There are two types of paths, **Absolute** and **Relative**.
- **Absolute** paths will specify a directory/file in the root directory and will begin with a /.
- **Relative** paths will specify a directory/file depending on where you are in the system.

One last important detail with the terminal is it is very sensitive! Make sure the command you are running is spelled correctly and doesnt have any unneeded capitals or spaces!!! üòµ‚Äçüí´
