# Class 4

[Back to home page](../README.md)

In this class we looked into **HTML** or *Hyper Text Markup Language*!

Starting an HTML site can be difficult from scratch, so many developers use a wireframe to start their website. a **Wireframe** is a blueprint for how you want the final product of your html directory to look like. This includes layouts of buttons, images, information, and links. Planning out a wireframe can be a big key to a successful start!

## What is HTML?

- HTML is the frame work of a website, this is where all the information is stored. Anything from text to images will be stored in the file. Combining all these tags together will create an **Element**.
- HTML always starts with a tag that includes a tag attribute to identify what the line will do, followed the content of the line and ending with a closeing tag with a /.
- An easy way to identify an html doc is the .html at the end of the url.
- Every HTML doc should have a header, body, and footer section with their appropriate information, as well as starting with both the tags DOCTYPE html and both ending and starting with the tags html.

- Here are a few examples of html documents.

Html documents have these things called **Semantics** that tell the tag what it wants it to do.

A few examples of semantics are-

1. Title, this goes in the header section and is the biggest piece of text in your website.
2. ul, an unordered list like a dot or dash
3. h1-6, sub titles throughout the website
4. p, paragraph or text section
5.a href="...", this will make a link

There are over 100 semantics, so ive included a [cheat sheet](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/html-semantics-cheat-sheet/) here!
