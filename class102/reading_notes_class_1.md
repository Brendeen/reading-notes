**Growth Mindset, _what is it_?**

- A growth mindest is having the idea that you can grow with practice, no matter how hard the subject/skill you are learning may be.
- People with a growth mindset typically see a challenge as a way to grow and learn.
- Learning from mistakes and faliure is key to a growth mindset. Taking it as a way to strengthen a skill is one of the most important parts of having a growth mindset.

**Ways i can keep a growth mindset:**

1. Look at every new assignment as a fun and challenging experience. ‚úçÔ∏è

2. Study and be passionate about my work, however big or small. üòÉ
3. **LEARN FROM MISTAKES!!!** üôå

## Learning markdown

- Markdown is a simple markup coding language similar to HTML with much simplier commands.
- Markdown is not a WYSIWYG kind of program, there are a few things you have to write to make your code work.

For example, to make a heading, you must put pound symbol(#) with a space before typing your title.
You can put up to **six** pound symbols depending on what size you want.

Some more examples of text can be making a word **BOLD** or _ITALICIZED_, and these are both very simple to do.
If you want text to be **BOLD**, you must put two asterisks symbols(**) in front and after your text.
If you want text to be _ITALICIZED_, you must put only one asterisk symbol(*) in front and after your text.

Adding links and images can be important for websites as well, to add a link, first put the text you want linked into brackets [], then in parentheses () put the URL link to the website.

Adding an image is just as easy but requires an extra step, first you must put an exclamation point followed by brackets ![] and type the name of the image inside the brackets, then in parentheses () place the image file inside.
