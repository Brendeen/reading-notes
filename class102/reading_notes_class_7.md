# Class 7

[Back to home page](../README.md)

In this class, we looked into **Programming with JavaScript**.

Control flow- this is how a computer executes statements from the first line of code and down to the bottom unless interupted by **Control Structures** that change the flow like conditonals or loops.

Javascript funtions are blocks of code designed to perform a specified task and is executed when a structure calls it.

Control structures are very common for javascript and include structures like *conditionals*, *loops* and *functions*.

## What is a Function?

Functions are made by writing the "function" keyword and a name, then adding parrentheses. () parameters are placed inside the parrentheses. The benefit of functions is you can use the **Return** feature to return previously used code to use again. you can also invoke or call functions multiple times.

function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... ) {

// code to be executed

}

When the function is invoked(called) the code will activate.

**Return** statements will stop executing the function. This can be used to return text from a javascript command to a paragraph element (< p>) such as a calculation.

using () will invoke the function, without it it will return the function object and not the function result.

### Javascript Operators

- Arithmetic Operators (mathmatical)
- Assignment Operators (values)
- Comparison Operators (compares)
- Logical Operators (logic)
- Conditional Operators (execute after a condition is made)
- Type Operators (what type the funtion is)
