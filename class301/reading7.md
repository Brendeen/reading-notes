## Explaining rest

Q. Who is Roy Fielding?

- Roy is a computer scientist and senior principle scientist at adobe, and is known for pioneering the way to the internet that we know today.

Q. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- My best guess would be its because we are only creating client side applications, so there is no way for us or our users to communicate through our webpages.

Q. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- They built the concept of REST.

Q. What does a GET do?

- GET is the human term for requesting a form of data from a recourse using a url.

Q. What does a POST do?

- POST is what updates the server we are using to display or update a resource, or rerender a page after a GET command is used.

Q. What does PUT do?

- PUT from my understanding completely rewrites a url and updates it with a new one.

Q. What does PATCH do?

- PATCH is similar to a game patch, where it updates partially. Not completely replacing the resource.

I have gotten all my API keys.
