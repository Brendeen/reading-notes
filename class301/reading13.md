## CRUD API speed build

Q. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

- REST is pretty much the structure centered around resources using http commands, while CRUD is a cycle that is used to control data through the use of http commands.

Q. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Identify what resources you would need.
2. Create your URLs to be used during crud.
3. Decide how to show or represent your resources.
4. Assign http methods to their corresponding function.
5. Continue to add any other features or quality of life improvments to your application. (Examples : styling, settings, about page.)
