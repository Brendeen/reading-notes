## 6 reasons for pair programming

Q. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaberation
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work enviroment readiness

Q. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

- So far for me, 3 has been the most beneficial. Learning from other students opens up so many new opportunities to learn, because everyone processes these skills differently and you can see how other people understand these concepts.

Q. How does pair programming work?

- Pair programming is done usually with 2 people. This can be either a driver and navigator method, or mob programming. The driver and navigator method has one person coding (driver) and another person either looking over reference or telling the driver what to type (navigator). Mob programming is collaberating together on the same code at the same time, both being the navigator and driver and is most efficient tacling a project with many parts to split up. You can have many people mob code as well.
